# Initech

So... what would you say you do here...?

## Overview

This is a very dumb http server implementation in go. It serves a directory of static files over http, and logs each req to stdout.

The directory of static files is set with the env var: `INITECH_PATH`

Useful for demo/helloworld purposes
